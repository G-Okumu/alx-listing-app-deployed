# Property Listing Page Documentation

## Project Description

This project involves building a **responsive property listing page** using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application will display a collection of luxury properties with:

- Filtering capabilities  
- A hero section  
- Clean and organized layout

The page is fully responsive and adapts to all screen sizes while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Implement responsive web design principles using **Tailwind CSS**
- Create **reusable React components** for layout (Header, Footer, Layout)
- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- Structure a **Next.js** application effectively
- Render **dynamic data** from an array of objects
- Implement **filtering functionality** for property listings
- Follow best practices in **component composition** and styling
- Break down **UI mockups** into logical components

---

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- Use **Next.js** as the React framework
- Use **TypeScript** for type checking
- Style components exclusively with **Tailwind CSS**
- Create **responsive layouts** for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Structure components in a logical **folder hierarchy**
- Use **functional components** with proper TypeScript typing

### Functional Requirements

#### Layout Components

- `Header` with navigation, logo, and search
- `Footer` with relevant links and information
- `Layout` wrapper for consistent page structure
